Introduction:
SoulWars is a web3 browser-based game where players are tasked with protecting their castles from invaders and acquiring resources to strengthen their castles. The game utilizes Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) to keep track of the player's progress and allows them to access their castles from anywhere in the world.

Access Control:
To play the game, players must have a ProfileToken, which can be acquired on the game's home screen. Each ProfileToken allows the player to create up to three CastleTokens, each representing a castle. The CastleTokens are stored on the blockchain, providing a permanent record of the player's progress in the game.

1 - Login screen: Players can create a ProfileToken if they don't have one yet.

2 - Choose your Castle screen: Players can choose which castle to play, create or delete castles.

3 - Game screen: The actual game where players protect their castle from invaders and acquire resources.

Interim Game:
For the purpose of demonstrating the use of Thirdweb SDK Unity, an interim game has been created. In this game, there is only one wizard protecting their castle, and the color of the wizard's clothes is initially set to white. However, players can customize the color of their wizard's clothes and update the metadata of their CastleToken.

Conclusion:
SoulWars is an exciting and innovative game that utilizes NFTs to provide players with a permanent record of their progress and allow them to access their castles from anywhere in the world. The game is still in development, but the interim game provides a glimpse into the potential of the full game and the use of blockchain technology in gaming.
